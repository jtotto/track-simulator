This my take on a simulator for the CS452 course train set.  It implements the
Marklin controller serial interface (documented at [1]) on a UNIX socket server
at 'marklin-simulator' in the abstract namespace, and displays the state of the
simulated trains and track graphically using graph_tool.  Time in the simulator
is advanced via key-presses - space to advance by one tick, 'n' to advance by
ten ticks.

This tool is originally based on the 'mock-train' simulator [2] by crazy2be's
group.  My improvements are:
- the ability to single-step time (intended as a companion for step-debugging
  with an emulated kernel)
- better visual presentation of the track graph
- more flexible, hackable simulation of train motion

To use this, you'll need to emulate your kernel and hook up its virtual serial
port to the simulator's UNIX socket.  QEMU is a common choice for this -
alternatively, I'm working on an emulator at the level of the documented
standard kernel interface to enable thread-aware source-level debugging right
now.
